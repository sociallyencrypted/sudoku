# sudoku
Simple Sudoku Solver made in Python 3. 

Accepts each row of the grid as an input, where the row is in the form of space seperated integers with 0 as placeholders for empty boxes.

Uses backtracing and recursion to validate the grid for each guess.

Thanks to Urvi for challenging me to make this!

## Run
```python3 solver.py```
